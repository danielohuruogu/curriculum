## Using aria-label and role for accessibility

- We saw previously what aria-label and role are used for but let's see them in use in another example

```
<a aria-label="Go to HuffPost News" role="button" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/">
```

- Above is the anchor tag that wraps around our logo svg
- We are using the aria-label attribute to tell a non-sighted user where they will be taken to upon interacting with our logo
- In this instance we've altered the default role of the anchor tag from a link to being a button.

## Completed Header

- Now if we run through with a Screen Reader we can see how our website works but how sure can we be that we are not breaking any accessibility guidance

## Axe DevTools

- Luckily there exists accessiblity checkers that we can use to find and fix any accessibility issues during development.
- One of these tools is axe DevTools which is a google chrome extension.

[Axe DevTools Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)
[Axe DevTools Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/)


To use Axe DevTools in Chrome:
- open inspect element in chrome or developer tools
- click the double arrow at the top of the dev tools window seen below

![Find Axe DevTools](../images/find-axe-devtools.png)

- Then select Axe DevTools
- Click Scan Page as seen below and Axe DevTools will check your website for any accessibility issues

![Use Axe DevTools](../images/use-axe-devtools.png)

## 1st Commit

- Now we have completed our header ticket, we are ready to commit our work to version control

- To do that we first make sure we are in a folder high enough up the directory tree to contain all of the changes we have made.

- We then add our files to staging, this is like a limbo land where work is waiting to be committed. We do this with the command:

```
git add .
```

- This adds all the changes to files in the current folder as well as the folders children to the staging area.

- We can check what files have been added to the staging area with the command:

```
git status
```

- Now that we have checked that our files have been added to the staging area, we can commit with the command:

```
git commit -m "Add Header including hamburger main menu and HuffPost Logo"
```

- We can check that our commit worked with the command:

```
git log --oneline 
```

- And finally we can push to our github repo using the command:

```
git push -u origin main
```
