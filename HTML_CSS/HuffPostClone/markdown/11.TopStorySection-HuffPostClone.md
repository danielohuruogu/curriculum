## Top Story Promo

Code:

```
<section id="top-story" class="top-story">
  <div class="top-story-promo">
    <a aria-label="BORIS TELLS UN: KERMIT THE FROG WAS WRONG"
      href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/boris-johnson-climate-speech-grow-up_uk_614ba488e4b03d83bace97c8"
      class="top-story-promo__headline">
      <h1>BORIS TELLS UN: KERMIT THE FROG WAS WRONG</h1>
    </a>

    <a class="top-story-promo__image"
      href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/boris-johnson-climate-speech-grow-up_uk_614ba488e4b03d83bace97c8"
      aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1">
      <img role="none" alt="" width="800" height="450" src="../../images/borisJohnson_800w.webp">
    </a>
  </div>
</section>
```

Recap:

- aria-hidden="true" removes an element from the accessibility tree
- tabindex="-1" prevents the element from being focusable meaning when a non-sighted user is using tab to navigate the page this element will be skipped
- role="none" changes the semantic meaning of the element it is used on from it's default to none, meaning no semantic meaning but it does not remove the element from the accessibility tree

- By default containers are not focusable e.g. div's and spans. That's why, in a previous example, you may have noticed tabindex="0" to make a div focusable. 
- A span will however be present in the accessibility tree by default, that's why we use the aria-hidden="true" attribute on it.
