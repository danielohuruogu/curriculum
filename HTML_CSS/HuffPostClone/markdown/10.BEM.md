## What is it?

- In our header we have a class acting on the logo called "nav__logo"

```
<svg class="nav__logo" version="1.1" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 720 90" xml:space="preserve" width="176px">
```

- BEM stands for block__element--modifier.

```
.block {}
.block__element {}
.block--modifer {}
.block__element--modifier {}
```

- .block represents the higher level of a component
- .block__element represents a child of block that forms part of block as a whole
- .block--modifier represents a different state of block so e.g. nav--red would be the nav block with a modified state of having a background-color of red

- the reason for double underscores and hyphens is so that your block can be hyphen delimited:

```
.top-story {}
.top-story__image {}
.top-story__image--big {}
```


## Why is it useful?

- BEM is a way of naming your CSS classes to give more transparency and meaning to other developers.
- They tell other developers more about what a piece of html is doing.
- It also indicates to the developer how different parts of the HTML are related.

Take this example:

```
.person {}
.person__hand {}
.person--female {}
.person--female__hand {}
.person__hand--left {}
```

vs written in 'normal' CSS:

```
.person {}
.hand {}
.female {}
.female-hand {}
.left-hand {}
```

These all make sense but feel more disconnected than the BEMified class names.

## To BEM or not to BEM?

There are two parts that often trip up developers new to BEM:
- The first is what to BEM, should every class on your page be named using BEM?
- Dealing with using BEM when you have an element within an element e.g. block__element__element

### What to BEM?

- In the previous example we looked at with the "nav__logo" class, we didn't neccasarily need to give the logo a "block__element" named class. Logo itself could have been a standalone block.
- It would make more sense to treat the logo as a block, however, if it was going to be present in another area of our site with the same styling which it's not. So in this case it probably makes sense to treat the logo as part of the navbar with nav as the block and logo as the element that forms part of the nav as a whole.

### Element within an element BEM

Sometimes you may have something like this:

```
<section class="top-story">
  <div class="top-story__text">
    <div class="top-story__text__headline">
```

- The first way to deal with having an element inside an element is shown above which is simply to be flexible with the BEM naming convention and allow for block__element__element.

- Another way to deal with this is simply to keep the class for the section but then treat the second element as the block:

```
<section class="top-story">
  <div class="news-card">
    <div class="news-card__headline">
```

- Finally you can keep the grouping of your classes so that they make sense to a developer by doing something like:

```
<section class="top-story">
  <div class="top-story__text">
    <div class="headline">
    </div>
    <div class="category">
```

Then simply group together the CSS classes:

```
.top-story__text .headline {}
.top-story__text .category {}
```

It is really up to you and your team which style you prefer, BEM is simply a tool to help add more meaning to the names of your CSS classes.
